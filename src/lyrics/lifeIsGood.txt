intro: <br/>
"everybody" <br/>

<br/><br/>

verse 1: louey <br/>
uh, i gotta do it like...this, yeah <br/>
yo enie, meanie, miney, mo <br/>
the competition gotta go <br/>
and if they don't speak english <br/>
i tell them adios! <br/>
i got the safety off <br/>
i'm ready to kill all of y'all <br/>
they solidified as kittens if they ain't my dawgs <br/>
feeling like the illest nigga living on the planet <br/>
man, i'm too fly, it's like i'm never ever landing <br/>
i do it for a reason 'cause i know you can't stand it <br/>
and i see you taking shots <br/>
but it's like your gun jammin' <br/>
hip-hop is dead, well i'm the one to resurrect the shit <br/>
new york, new york, i'm the one to represent the shit <br/>
from the old heads to the youngin's <br/>
they respect the shit <br/>
since '93, i been recking shit <br/>
i'm going all the way up 'cause sky's the limit <br/>
still so humble crusin' in my honda civic <br/>
i ain't throwing shade but i'm rapping what i'm living <br/>
bars hit harder than a lesson full of physics <br/>
let's get it <br/>
    
<br/> <br/>

chorus: <br/>
back in the days, when i was young <br/>
i’m not a kid anymore <br/>
some days ain't like the ones that i was living before <br/>
some days i'm reminiscing and <br/>
it make a nigga really wish he was a kid again, ayo <br/>
back in the days, when i was young <br/>
i’m not a kid anymore <br/>
some days ain't like the ones that i was living before <br/>
some days i'm reminiscing and <br/>
it make a nigga really wish he was a kid again <br/>

<br/> <br/>

verse 2: oscar <br/>
you on point, dawg? <br/>
all the time, my nigga <br/>
so what’s poppin’? what’s on your mind, my nigga? <br/>
i'm thinking i should be happy that i'm breathing, yep <br/>
i'm trying to shake the devil <br/>
i'm exorcising my demons <br/>
straight up, shit is real <br/>
and any day could be your last, my nigga <br/>
life's too short to dwell in the past <br/>
but when it comes to this rap shit, i’m a genius, right? <br/>
'cause everybody looking at me like i'm jesus christ <br/>
he’s just nice! <br/>
i had good enough people tell me i ain’t good enough <br/>
the hood told me i ain't hood enough <br/>
so i disregard that, i cop a new fitted <br/>
rest in peace to my haters, yeah, i told them good riddance <br/>
all of the chit-chatter's getting a little ridiculous <br/>
made it past 21, now serendipity's limitless <br/>
it’s goodbye for now, the time we spent was stellar <br/>
queens get the money, yeah, i’m reppin’ forever <br/>
let’s go <br/>

<br/> <br/>

chorus: <br/>
back in the days, when i was young <br/>
i’m not a kid anymore <br/>
some days ain't like the ones that i was living before <br/>
some days i'm reminiscing and <br/>
it make a nigga really wish he was a kid again, ayo <br/>
back in the days, when i was young <br/>
i’m not a kid anymore <br/>
some days ain't like the ones that i was living before <br/>
some days i'm reminiscing and <br/>
it make a nigga really wish he was a kid again <br/>
