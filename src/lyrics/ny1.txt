<br/><br/>

verse 1: <br/>
wanna solidify myself as one of the greatest <br/>
provide you with new sounds <br/>
these are some of my latest <br/>
gotta stay on my p’s <br/>
cause success won’t come overnight <br/>
what you may see as a dream <br/>
others view as an oversight <br/>
niggas could never deal with an ego as gigantic as mine <br/>
that’s why you see me rocking solo almost all of the time <br/>
it’s why i’m never wilding out for support out here <br/>
‘cause real niggas hard to find like remotes... <br/>
inspired from what i read the other day in this message <br/>
prepare yourself for the worst <br/>
never change your objective <br/>
lots of snakes in the grass <br/>
so it’s time that you cut it off <br/>
we rocking the same fabrics <br/>
but i’m cut from a different cloth <br/>
analyzed my trajectory <br/>
i’m bound to do something greater <br/>
‘cause i’m about to blow <br/>
and they're still stuck on the elevator <br/>
whenever it get hard to keep them eyes wide <br/>
always remember that the money keep them eyes dry <br/>
what that sound like? <br/>

<br/><br/>

verse 2: <br/>
i need a space with better quality of oxygen <br/>
it's detrimental i'm inhaling all these toxins in <br/>
i need a view overlooking the metropolis <br/>
and have a white butler like i'm samurai apocalypse <br/>
i know some heathens quoting legendary bible quotes <br/>
i know some people switching patterns like kaleidoscopes <br/>
i need to go lay my head where it's tropical <br/>
and have my dream girl rubbing up on my abdominal <br/>
i want the finer things, exquisite opulence <br/>
and put elaborate stamps on my travel documents <br/>
despite all of your misguided presumptions <br/>
i'm always looking to do the right thing <br/>
i got a moral compass <br/>
tell you what they told me before <br/>
if opportunity don’t knock, then build a door <br/>
whenever it get hard to keep them eyes wide <br/>
always remember that the money keep them eyes dry <br/>
what's your life like? <br/>
