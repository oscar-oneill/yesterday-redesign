verse 1: oscar <br/>
i never knew a love, la-la-love, a love (like this) <br/> 
gotta be something from deep to write this <br/>
look, fascinated by your allure <br/>
the way you’re rocking designer fashion <br/>
all the latest couture <br/>
i take a mental note <br/>
of all the things that you be telling me <br/>
the sound of your voice is one of my favorite melodies <br/>
i'm trying to lay back, girl, recline with you <br/>
no need to fret about it <br/>
give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it <br/>
(here we go again) <br/>
rarely do i ever get my feelings involved <br/>
so i wrote my feelings down, turned it into a song <br/>
got love for you, i may not exhibit it <br/>
you should know that capricorns are naturally inhibited <br/>
you should know that every moment that we spend is magnificent <br/>
if i'm on my last dollar <br/>
you're the one that i'd split it with <br/>
i'm wrapped around your love <br/>
got me feeling like an s-curl <br/>
you know your smile is your best curve <br/>

<br/><br/>

chorus: <br/>
never in my wildest dreams <br/>
never in my wildest dreams (woo woo woooo) <br/>
never in my wildest dreams <br/>
never in my wildest dreams <br/>
i had dreams of fucking an r&b bitch <br/>
but then i met you <br/>
you kinda flipped the whole script, yeah <br/>
i’ve always known from the start <br/>
was hoping maybe one day <br/>
that you would give me your heart <br/>

<br/><br/>

verse 2: melayna <br/>
now when you walk through the door <br/>
i hear the melodies of love when they call <br/>
i’m in love with you <br/>
(i asked you nicely don't make the dogg lose it) <br/>
because i never knew love before <br/>
no i never knew love before <br/>
no i never knew <br/>
knew, love, love <br/>
until you <br/>

<br/><br/>
