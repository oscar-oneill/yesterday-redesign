 interlude: samuel l. jackson <br/>
waaake up! <br/>
wake up, wake up, wake up! <br/>
up you wake, up you wake, up you wake, up you wake <br/>
this is mr. señor love daddy, your voice of choice <br/>
the world's only 12-hour, strong man on the air <br/>
here on we love radio 108 fm <br/>
the last on your dial, but first in your heart <br/>
and that's the truth, ruth <br/>
here i am <br/>
am i here? you know it! <br/>
it you know <br/>
this is mr. señor love daddy <br/>
doing the nasty to your ears <br/>
your ears to the nasty <br/>
i's only play the platters that matter <br/>
the matters they platter <br/>
and that's the truth, ruth <br/>
from the heart of bed-stuy <br/>
you're listening to we love radio <br/>
