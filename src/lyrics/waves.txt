 verse 1: <br/>
if glory be to god, they better sanctify me <br/>
dildo to the mouth of any sucker mc <br/>
a lot of niggas ask me why i rap like i’m pissed off <br/>
a lot of niggas rap softer than vaginal discharge <br/>
i’m an enigma, i’m unparalleled <br/>
come aboard this lyrical carousel <br/>
an angry black man, a young samuel <br/>
line ‘em up one by one, i'll eviscerate my opponents… <br/>
”how you want it?” <br/>
“…rest in peace to you niggas, let's take a moment…” <br/>
since the start of the new millennium (uh huh) <br/>
all i dream about is sleeping in condominiums <br/>
silk boxers under the bathrobe, luxurious lifestyle <br/>
my lifestyle's anonymous, distant from columnists <br/>
i’m the human embodiment of supernatural dominance <br/>
ascending from the ashes, maturing to prominence <br/>
and then i realized everything comes and it goes <br/>
i'm trying to get it before it come and it goes <br/>
